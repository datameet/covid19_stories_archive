<p>JODHPUR: A vegetable seller was allegedly harasssed because of his faith and was humiliated when he went out to sell the goods.</p>
<p>Not only he was made to apologise but also asked to hold hisehis and do sit-ups.&nbsp;The police have now taken action against the person who was responsible for harassment and has arrested him.&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to reports, the incident occurred in Bhuratiya locality in Jodhpur district of Rajasthan. When the vendor, Yasin, son of Luqman, went to the area with his handcart, he was asked his name.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yasin was asked to show his identity card and when he told his name, he was mistreated and questioned that how he dared enter the locality, said local media reports. He was accused of 'spreading Corona' (as heard in the video). Later, he was asked to do sit-ups in full public view.</p>
<p>The incident was recorded and later the clip went viral on social media. The video was shared and people came to know about the incident. Subsequently, police went to the spot and identified the accused--Rahul Parihar.&nbsp;The police have arrested Rahul.&nbsp;'Yasin, a resident of Ganesh Colony, had gone to Bhuratia where he was stopped, asked his name, threatened and made to do sit ups", quotes&nbsp;<a style="font-size: 9pt;" href="https://www.patrika.com/jodhpur-news/man-arrested-for-spreading-false-news-of-curfew-extension-in-jodhpur-6056358/" target="_blank">Patrika</a>, in a report.</p>
<p>"The accused has been arrested for outraging religious sentiments", it further said. The arrest was made on Thursday. 'Earlier, there have been several such incidents in other parts of the country. A BJP leader in Uttar Pradesh, recently threatened a vegetable vendor.</p>
<p>In another incident, a person was booked in Delhi for threatening a vegetable seller last month. Besides, an incident of not taking grocery from a Muslim delivery man, had occurred in Thane (Maharashtra) and in that case too police had registered a case on the basis of delivery man's complaint.</p></div>

		<div style="padding:10px"><a href="quick-bits?story=491" ?=""><img src="uploads/crime/jain_bakery_chennai_discriminatino.jpg" align="right" style="width:100%;display:block;"></a></div>	<p></p><p>CHENNAI: A bakery is in the midst of controversy over a message it put up, announcing that all the food products are prepared by Jains and there was no Muslim in the staff.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Jain bakery and confectioneries is located in T Nagar in Chennai.&nbsp;In a social media post that was circulated on WhatsApp and that later made way to other social platforms as well, the bakery highlighted that all eatables were 'made by Jains' and there was 'no Muslim staff'.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After it was spotted, there was outrage. People also objected on social media and tagged the officials. Legal experts say that it was an attempt to ostracise an entire community and an attempt to incite people, also affecting the right to equality and religious harmony in the society.</p>
<p>Besides, publication of such an advertisement (or message) is liable for prosecution under different sections, they said.&nbsp;A Times of India report <a style="font-size: 9pt;" href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/chennai-row-over-bakerys-no-muslim-staff-text/articleshow/75615905.cms" target="_blank">quoted</a> a bakery representative that there was a WhatsApp message about eateries employing Muslims and this announcement was in its response. Social media users have raised the issue. The twitter handle of Greater Chennai police stated that it had taken cognisance.</p>

	<h3><a href="quick-bits?story=490">Over 92% Coronavirus patients cured in Kerala, state shows the way</a></h3>
		<div style="padding:10px"><a href="quick-bits?story=490" ?=""><img src="uploads/lifestyle/health_checkup_pexel_treatment_cure_hospital.jpg" align="right" style="width:100%;display:block;"></a></div>	<p></p><p>NEW DELHI: Kerala has shown the way to other Indian states with its handling of the Coronavirus outbreak.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, in the state that has so far registered 500 confirmed cases, only 34 active cases remain.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Out of 500, as many as 462 patients have been cured--a figure of over 92%. No state comes close to Kerala when it comes to dealing with Covid 19, in India.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In fact, the state that has a huge expatriate population and that was leading in number of cases, initially, is now at the 16th place. There is no fresh case. Out of these 500 cases, there were just four deaths.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Maharashtra, Delhi, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and several other states are still facing a growing number of cases. Also, the figure of deaths is very high in certain states, especially, Maharashtra, Gujarat, MP and West Bengal.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Right now, Maharashtra has the highest number of confirmed cases i.e. 12,974. The figure is so high because of the cases in Mumbai. This is followed by Gujarat 5,804, Delhi 4,898, Tamil Nadu 3,550, Rajasthan 3,061, MP 2,942, UP 2,766, AP 1,650, West Bengal 1,259, Punjab 1,232 and Telangana 1,085.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Across the country, there have been 44,870 confirmed cases, out of them 30,850 are active cases and 12,942 is the number of those who have recovered. The figure of deaths, nationwide is 1,524. Clearly, Kerala model needs to learnt, replicated in order to check Covid 19 in other regions of the country.</p>
